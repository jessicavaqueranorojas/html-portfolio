<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Jessica Rojas and I have 4 years in the public school sector. I

  I am transforming my skills and looking to change careers. I am currently
  taking the Career Pathway in Front-End Development by Codecademy. My goals are
  to complete this pathway and possiobly begin the Pathway for Back-End
  Development as well. I want to transition out of Education and into the tech
  world, preferably as a Front-End Engineer or a Software/Fullstack Engineer.

  When I am not working, I love to spend time with family and my husband, Noel.
  I really enjoy my two loving pups, Cosmos and Comet. I enjoy going to the gym,
  walking and watching a lot of TV or movies!
